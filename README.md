# React Project Starter Template

## Introduction

This starter template is designed as a minimal yet robust starting point for React-based projects, utilizing Vite for fast builds and hot module replacement. It's tailored to streamline the setup process, allowing you to kickstart development with best practices in mind.

## Features

- **Vite**:
- **React Router v6**:
- **React Icons**: Included to enrich the UI with scalable icons.
- **Axios**: Added for making HTTP requests.

## Structure

The project is structured to promote a modular approach, making it scalable and easy to maintain:

- `src/layouts`: Defines the main page layouts to wrap around various content.
- `src/pages`: Contains the individual pages of the application, each representing a different route.
- `src/components`: Reusable UI components that can be shared across different pages and layouts.
